A dependency-free command-line interface for interacting with LLMs with an OpenAI-compatible API. This script allows you to have conversational chats directly from your terminal.
## Features

*   **Interactive Chat:** Engage in conversational chats with LLMs.
*   **Conversation History:** Maintains a history of your conversation within a session.

*   `--base-url`: Your base URL. (e.g., `https://api.openai.com/v1`)
